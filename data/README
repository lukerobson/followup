For confirmed exoplanets
There are 4 diffrent sources:

Exoplanet Data Explorer - http://exoplanets.org - exorg.php
NASA Exoplanet Archive - https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu - exonasa.php
Czech Astronomical Society - http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/ - exovar2.php
ExoFOP-TESS - https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/ - 

Each of which has its own page that creates the CSV file that is needed. 

For TESS Targets of interest;
https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/ - tess.php 

For K2 candidates;
https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu - K2exoplanets.php
